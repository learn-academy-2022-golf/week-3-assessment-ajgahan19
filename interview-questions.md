3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is an unnamed function, as in it is not directly attached to a variable. I believe, for example, the functions inside higher order functions would be considered anonymous.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?
Your answer: State is data saved locally through user input, props are bits of data made available across React components through props syntax.

Researched answer: The DOM is a representation of a created web page that can be displayed in the browser during development.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?
Your answer: A div is used to "lump" together elements in html and jsx as a single customizable element. I'm not sure when it comes to span, but will research it and can get a better answer.
Researched answer: They are similar in their use for grouping elements together for common styling and use, but span is an inline element.
